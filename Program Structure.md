The program structure for C++ programming language is looks like this :

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	return 0;
}
```

---

Now, we are going to write our very first program that prints =="Hello, World"== to the console.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//This is the main function where code execution begins
int main(){

    // Writing the very first program to print the "Hello, World" to the console
    cout << "Hello, World"; 

    //Return OS to 0, indicating the program is executed successfully
    return 0;
}
```
