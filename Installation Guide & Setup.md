To begin our journey and dive into the learning process of C++ , we just need have to setup our computational machine to desired outcome. So without further ado let's get started :

#### What is C++ ?
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that supports object-oriented programming.
It is static and strongly typed programming language useful for Gaming, Servers etc.

#### Install Necessary Tools

- **Install C++ Compiler:** You'll need a compiler to run C++ code. Options include:

    - [**GCC**](https://gcc.gnu.org) for Linux or mac OS (included in Xcode).
    - [**MinGW**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) for Windows.
    - [**Microsoft Visual Studio**](https://code.visualstudio.com) with C++ support.

- **Set Up an IDE:** Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like[ Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), or [Code::Blocks](https://codeblocks.org) to write and test your C++ code.
